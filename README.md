- 👋 Hi, I’m @Lucianosnjr
- 👀 I'm interested in building an excellent career in development full stack and I'm currently also starting to be interested in mobile development.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning POO em Java, JavaScript, HTML, CSS and I'm also studying systems analysis and development at university.
- 💞️ At the moment I'm just dedicating myself to personal projects because I don't have opportunities as I'm at the beginning of my career and studies. But I would definitely love an internship or job opportunity.
- 📫 How to reach me >> You can send an email to lucianosnjr@gmail.com, as I am watching my mail.
