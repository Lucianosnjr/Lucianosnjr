- 👋 Hi, I’m @Lucianosnjr
- 👀 I'm interested in building an excellent career in BackEnd and I'm currently also starting to be interested in mobile development.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning POO em Java and I'm also studying systems analysis and development at university.
- 💞️ At the moment I'm not able to collaborate on any projects, as I'm still at the beginning of my career as a developer and therefore don't have much experience or opportunities.
- 📫 How to reach me >> You can send an email to lucianosnjr@gmail.com, as I am watching my mail.
